# image-colorizer
This website colorizes black and white images using a neural network backend. Created for CSCI121 at Harvey Mudd. Written for python 3.7.4. For running locally, we recommend setting up a pyenv virtualenv then installing requirements from devrequirements.txt with ```pip install -r devrequirements.txt```
